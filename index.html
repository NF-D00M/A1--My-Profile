  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in technology began when I was 7 years old when a Gameboy Colour could be found in the hand of every child. Most kids were interested in trading Pokémon, but I was more concerned with the 8-bit chiptune omitting from the speakers. I would turn on my Gameboy just to listen to the music. To this day I still listen to orchestral renditions of the Legend of Zelda. 
Since then, my love for technology evolved through the expression of music in film and art. I believe the success of most entertainment is contributed to the accomplishments of composers and sound engineers, how else can you convey the melancholy and suspense in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar without Hans Zimmer’s score? Why is opera in Italian so listenable in a language we do not fully understand? How does the repetition of gaming continue to hold a frustrated audience? It is with the symbiotic relationship between music and art created with the available technology. 
Technology has revolutionised the music industry. Digital software, Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and smartphones provide anyone the potential to listen, write and record music with the push of a button. If it wasn’t for the 8-bit chiptune in my first Gameboy and the acceleration of technology I doubt music would be this influential in my life today. 
I have chosen to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT because of the university’s reputation, course structure and networking opportunities. My plan is to acquire the knowledge to advance my career in the technology space and to understand programming languages that are translatable across industries and music. As a Business Analyst I would like to further my understanding of Data Analysis, Big Data and Machine Learning, and to take advantage of the coding programs (HTML, CSS, Java, Python, C, C++, etc.) offered throughout each course. Currently my education pathway is leading toward software engineering, this is one of the crucial components to one day become Head of Technology.
