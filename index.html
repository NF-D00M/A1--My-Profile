    <h4>Interesting Fact</h4>
      <p>I enjoy playing piano and listening to classical music. I find the process similar to coding, there are strict rules that apply to the key signature, program the wrong note and you will hear the syntax error. It is my life’s goal to play all of Frederic Chopin’s Nocturnes and to communicate the sound of some of history’s greatest composers. </p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    
      <p>My interest in technology began when I was 7 years old when a Gameboy Colour could be found in the hand of every child. Most kids were interested in trading Pokémon, but I was more concerned with the 8-bit chiptune omitting from the speakers. I would turn on my Gameboy just to listen to the music. To time of writing I still listen to orchestral renditions of the Legend of Zelda.</p>
      <p>Since then, my love for technology evolved through the expression of music in film and art. I believe the success of most entertainment is contributed to the accomplishments of composers and sound engineers, how else can you convey the melancholy and suspense in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar without Hans Zimmer’s score? Why is opera in Italian so listenable in a language not everybody fully understands? How does the repetition of gaming continue to hold a frustrated audience? I tend to agree with Juslin & Väsfäll’s (2008) publication, that when music triggers an emotional response it can have a very strong symbiotic relationship with art.</p> 
      <p>Beckstead (2001) states that technology has revolutionised the music industry; Digital software, smartphones and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) provide anyone the potential to listen, write and record music with the push of a button. If it wasn’t for the 8-bit chiptune in my first Gameboy and the acceleration of accessible technology I doubt music would be this influential in my life today.</p>
      <p>I have chosen to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT because of the university’s reputation, course structure and networking opportunities. My plan is to advance my career in the technology space and to understand programming languages that are translatable across industries and applicable to music. As a Business Analyst I would like to further my understanding of Data Analysis, Big Data and Machine Learning, and to take advantage of the coding programs (HTML, CSS, Java, Python, C, C++, etc.) offered throughout each course.</p>
  
    <h2>IT Experience</h2>
    <p>I am Business Analyst for Tabcorp Wagering in a global leading Wagering Control Centre. During this role I have championed many projects across the technology space. In short, my experience entails the following accomplishments:</p>
 
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>Data Analysis</li> 
        Improving through 6 Sigma DMAIC.
        <li>Software Implementation</li> 
        Applying digital transformation strategies.
        <li>Software Design</li> 
        Eliciting requirements via Agile.
        <li>Release Management</li> 
        Deploying new software.
        <li>Machine learning</li> 
        Feeding supervised datasets.
        <li>Quality Assurance</li> 
        Building test cases. 
        <li>Application Support</li> 
        Identifying and mitigating risk.
        <li>Workplace (hardware)</li> 
        Enhancing user experience.
    </ul>
 
    <p>Each role listed above has aided my long-term goal to become Head of Technology. I would like to improve data systems and manage a team of software engineers developing innovative applications, but before I get there, I must accept the next challenge. I would like to become a Software Engineer either after graduation or before my study is complete. It is essential that I understand the computing architecture if I am ever to lead a team of software engineers, therefore I must learn programming languages and gain experience in full-stack development.</p>

  
  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    
    <h3>Position Description</h3>
      <p>I will continue to take advantage of the job opportunities and relationships I have built at Tabcorp to become a Software Engineer Lead. This position listed at Tabcorp requires the successful candidate to lead a team of developers to create and maintain gaming software in the wagering sector. Tabcorp Wagering is a gaming platform that provides gambling opportunities for racing events, sporting entertainment and lotteries. Developing gaming software suggests that these applications must be accessible via web, app (iOS and Android), and at retail venues. A key component is to redesign their digital experience and innovate wagering product through technology solutions. This would involve focusing on the UX design disciplines as explained by Green (2019); experience strategy, integration design, user research and information architecture. </p>
      <p>This position appeals to me because it is an opportunity to express my creativity through technology, much like playing piano mentioned at the beginning of my profile. Software Engineers build the architecture in the back-end and influence the design at the front-end. This type of work allows employees to work autonomously which is the biggest contributing factor to job satisfaction (Simmons, Gooty, Nelson & Little, 2009). I am an internal applicant for this role, and I have already built strong relationships across the business which can be one of the most difficult challenges when starting a new job, therefore I have a network of people to excel.</p>

    <h3>Skills & Expereince Required for Position</h3>
      <p>The necessary skills required to be a successful Software Engineer Lead include knowledge of in-demand computer programming languages (Java, Python, C#/.Net, Mean, Ruby, etc.) and business Intelligence reporting tools (Power BI, Oracle Analytics) to communicate across, down and up stream. Applicate must have experience in software development strategies involving the end-to-end process; designing, testing, implementing, and debugging. Applicant would understand how to elicit requirements from users to enhance user experience and have a grasp of Relational Database Management Systems.</p>
      <p>Applicant would need to demonstrate challenging problem-solving skills and express critical thinking in moments of crisis. Additionally, applicant must convey high-level communication and have the ability to work in a team using Agile framework. Applicant could be considered advantageous if they have gaming industry experience and are able to work on weekends or on-call. </p>
    
    <h3>Qualifications Required for Position</h3>
      <p>A successful applicant must hold a Bachelors degree in either Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Programming or Mathematics. Applicants would need 3-5 years of field experience to be considered and must possess an accomplished technology portfolio boasting achievements and design strategies. Understanding that the technology industry is continually transforming the applicant must be willing to enrol in short courses for upskilling in areas focusing on modern technology trends and delivery strategies.</p>
 
    <h3>Skills, Qualifications & Experience I currently Possess</h3>
      <p>My current role as a Business Analyst has exposed many facets of technology and the business. I am the bridge the connects technology to operations and it my duty to improve operations through technology solutions. I am agent of change and have experience in software design using agile framework and large-scale software implementation; this includes being a part of the end-to-end process by facilitating meetings with developers, showcasing requirements, building quality assurance test cases and training users on the front-line. </p>
      <p>Putting the business first before seeking improvements from technology has allowed me to understand the importance of user-experience. I hold weekly meetings presenting accurate data analysis with users so that they can suggest areas for improvement and identify risk. Applying 6 Sigma DMAIC framework has increased our operations Sigma rating from a 4 to 5.6 over the last 3 years. Minimising defects has become my operational goal and I contribute this success to constantly updating software that contains error-proofing technology. </p>
      <p>My second responsibility is to provide on-call operational support, this involves risk mitigation and damage control during unplanned system outages. My problem-solving skills are challenged weekly due to the unpredictable nature of large-scale organisations, I must minimise impact to the business while holding customer expectation. Additionally, I have 10+ years of wagering industry experience and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
    
    <h3>Plan to Obtain Missing Job Requirements</h3>
      <p>To obtain the role of Software Engineer Lead my plan is to study a Bachelor of Information Technology part-time with a slow and conservative approach to build my software portfolio and apply that to my current work. One example is that I am currently learning Python in a Programming course and I am in the process of learning data extraction from databases. I can now take these learnings and develop a program that will place all performance data into files (.xml, .xls) for performance managers to review and analyse.</p>
      <p>Along this journey I will study a minor of Software Engineering to learn a vast number of coding languages and techniques for both front-end and back-end development. I acknowledge that the Software Engineering role attached is for a lead/senior position, but over the course of my study I hope to move into Technology once I have grasped more computer science concepts. Alternatively, I can offer my services as a Junior Software Engineer when I apply for the role and review my application for the senior position once I have gained more experience. </p>
      <p>I would need further experience developing high-level innovative business strategies, business intelligence reporting tools and communicating upstream to senior management. I have no doubt that I am projected to learn these skill while studying IT, but to gain an advantage I can increase my responsibility at work. To practise communicating upstream I will ask the Head of Parimutuel Operations if I can help with budgeting and present monthly reports to her general manager. To understand the core disciplines of UX Design I will sit with the development team one day per week and ask any questions; this will help me gain the confidence to code front-end before I move into the technology space. The final requirement would be to gain experience in Software Engineering Project Management; deciding scope, cost estimation, scheduling tasks and managing resources.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Personal File</h2>
    Insert Snapshot of Myer Briggs and Big Five
      <p>To perform and grow it is important for students and employees to understand their personality type so that they can identify their strengths and weaknesses. Listed below are the results for both the Myer-Briggs Personality Test and The Big Five Personality Test. </p>
      <p>My results from the Myer Briggs Personality test seem to align with most of the traits from The Big Five Personality Test. Both tests suggest that I am high in creativity and imagination, this includes brainstorming ideas in a group setting. Challenging the status quo and idea sharing is advantageous when working with a team because it allows everyone’s opinion to be heard and weighted. Scoring high in openness implies that I enjoy unique self-expression which is great for leadership, building teams and innovation. Leaders must think outside the box or believe the box doesn’t exist to design innovative product and reinvent businesses processes. Knowing that I possess these traits shapes confidence toward becoming a leader in the technology space and encourages me to pursue the role of a Software Engineer Lead before finishing my Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
      <p>Myer-Briggs indicates that my leadership style is an Advocate, meaning I will connect with individuals through empathy putting their needs first. High in empathy can be both a positive and a negative. I would need to learn how to detach from the feelings of my colleagues so that I can focus on my tasks before moving onto theirs. This can be avoided by creating regimented plans for projects. Measuring the team’s performance provides a visual status of project progression, then I can assess where I am succeeding or failing before helping the team. </p> 
      <p>Both tests indicate that I respond poorly to criticism and that I can be softly spoken in an uncomfortable setting. I do agree that I tend to let criticism form into self-doubt if it is delivered with content from my employer. I feel a sense of dread when I forget to resolve minor tasks when I am faced with large-scale projects. This supports my need to prioritise larger-scale projects that impact the business, rather than the needs of one individual. When forming a team, I will acknowledge that if I failing to complete a minor request then I would need a nudge from the team to bring that request back into vision. One-one-one meetings and weekly progress meetings are a great way for the team to discuss ideas and troubleshoot blockers.</p>
      <p>One contradiction between the two tests is that I scored high in introversion with Myer-Briggs and high in extroversion with The Big Five. What I can take from this is that I believe my entire nature is introverted, but in a group-setting I can be forward with conversation and outgoing when I want to connect with people. I think this is due to my empathetic character. I am aware I can be reserved but when I am comfortable all I really desire is the respect from others.  </p>
      <p>The third test I have chosen to build my personal profile is the Creative Types Test by Adobe Creative found on https://mycreativetype.com/about/. I chose this test because I believe that if I am to grow as an innovative leader I must explore the most essential leadership quality, creativity (Hughes, Lee, Tian, Newman & Legood, 2018). The Creative Types Test conveys that everyone can be creative, but they just don’t know their creative strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    
    Insert Thinker Image
       <p>My results suggest that I am a ‘Thinker.’ A Thinker has intellectual curiosity and always tries to find and create meaning. I perceive this as advantageous leadership qualities if I am to build new digital experiences outlined in the above job description. Leaders must instil and drive meaning in projects to keep the employees motivated. According to Prinsloo & Van Deventer (2017) Gartner’s hype cycle suggests that long-term technology projects deal with fluctuating levels of employee, therefore keeping moral high is a challenge through the project’s life. Defining meaning with each members contribution to the team is imperative to boost morale. I will do this by discovering what motivates my teammates individually and remind them of their growth opportunities throughout the project.</p>
       <p>The Thinker often gets entangled between theory and practise, letting their analytical behaviour dominate their character. When working with teams I will need to ensure that I take action and not put scope creep at risk by over analysing every detail.  </p>
       <p>The results of these three personality tests have brought a deep sense awareness to my learning style. Identifying strengths and weakness across the Myer-Briggs and the Big Five highlights’ areas for improvement and inspires confidence when presented with new challenges, especially when working in teams. Although, the results of all three tests are generalised, I do believe it is truly impossible to analyse an individual’s personality and leadership qualities purely online with a five-point Likert scale. Individuals also change over time, but the key idea is awareness and that’s the perfect place to start. </p>

  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Cram Lock is a third party educational tool that possesses the ability to select and lock unproductive applications which cannot be unlocked until a user has spent dedicated time on other productive applications. The functionality of Cram Lock follows.</p>
      <ol> 
        <li>From their device users select productive applications they wish to dedicate their time.</li>
        <li>Users select unproductive applications they wish to lock.</li>
        <li>Users input the time frame of how long they must spend on productive applications for unproductive applications to unlock.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Locked time is configurable.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Users input how often unproductive applications reset to a locked status.</li>
          <ul> 
            <li>Lock Reset time is configurable.</li>
            </ul>
       </ol>
</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The development of Cram Lock addresses three core phenomenon impacting society: the acceleration of information retrieval, the decline of literacy and unproductive applications.</p>
      <p>Lundstrom (2003) argues that Information Technology is evolving at an exponential rate; Moore’s law states that computer processing power doubles every two years due to microchip transistors decreasing in size and the production of computers halving in cost. This indicates that if Moore’s Law continues its upward projection, then the speed of information retrieval via technology streams will follow its course. Information retrieval allows users to discover content and express knowledge through numerous online learning platforms with the online education market estimated to be at $350 Billion (Koksal,2020). It’s safe to say that paperback encyclopedias and dictionaries are now redundant thanks to Google’s Search Engine. There is no denying that the revolution of technology has improved information sharing but this comes with its disadvantages. </p>
      <p>Machine learning algorithms are so accurate that they can identify misspelled words on smartphones and can predict sentences before a user has finished typing (Stoop & Van Den Bosch, 2019). Regrettably, Bowerman (2015) suggests that predictive text has led to the decline of written literacy; users do not learn from autocorrect and often confuse the correct use of grammar. This poses the question, if written literacy has declined since the introduction and acceleration of information sharing, which other education sectors are at threat? Today’s digital software on computers and modern synthesizers can store an entire library of instruments, users can access any sound by interacting with a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) (Beckstead, 2001). Designed within MIDI is a function called Automatic Error Correction (AER), that automatically corrects diatonic harmony if users play outside of the key signature (Marinov 2020). </p>
      <p>For example, if a user declares the key signature as G Major and then play’s an F, then MIDI will automatically correct the F to an F#Sharp</p>
      <p>AER makes creating music more productive, but again this comes with a sacrifice to literacy and deep learning. The entire foundation of learning musical harmony is built around scales and their key signatures, similar to predictive text favoured over spelling. Henschen (2018) claims there is a tragic decay of music theory, and it doesn’t help that classical music in general only appeals to an older audience. Along with spelling could music theory become a forgotten art? </p>
      <p>Unproductive applications can be considered applications that users receive no value, this phenomenon is known as scrolling (Lupinacci, 2021). Lupinacci contintues to delve further into the subject and suggests that these apps can be predominantly linked to social media which can cause anxiety and fatigue. Wouldn’t it be beneficial if unproductive applications weren’t available until users had declared that they have had a productive day?</p>
      <p>It is Cram Lock’s endeavour to make online learning platforms a smartphone priority. Considering there are 6.64 billion smartphone users in the world (Turner 2022), almost one smartphone per person, this may indicate that there is an opportunity in the palm of every hand globally. The project will take advantage of iOS and Android and build an application that locks selected apps which cannot be unlocked until users have completed their dedicated time on other nominated apps. </p>
      <p></p>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Cram lock operates on the function that nominated unproductive applications cannot be accessed until a user has spent the adequate time on other productive apps. Following the process control Cram Lock can be defined by the following business requirements.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Select Productive Apps</li>
            <li>Select Unproductive Apps</li>
            <li>Input Lock Time</li>
            <li>Input Lock Reset Time</li>
          </ol>
</p>
      <p>Select Productive Apps. Productive applications are apps that the user generates value. The perfect example would be DuoLingo; a language-learning platform where users ascend a tress of skills to practise vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation. Users will have access to specified productive applications and non-specified applications throughout their smartphone.</p>
      <p>Select Unproductive Apps. Users then must select unproductive applications that provide little value. If Facebook was selected, then Facebook cannot be unlocked until a user has spent the dedicated time on productive applications. Locked unproductive apps will be blacked out on the user’s home screen. Additionally, notifications and alerts will be disabled until the applications are unlocked, this will mimic the ‘do not disturb function.</p>
      <p>Input Lock Time. Users can input the duration of time they must spend on productive applications for unproductive applications to unlock. Input can be defined to the minute, hour, specific time, or day. Smartphones will access their own data to analyse how long a user has spent on each application. Locking applications can be configurable per app i.e. Facebook can be set to 1 hour and Instagram can be set to 30 minutes, therefore users are only required to spend 30 minutes on Duolingo before Instagram is unlocked but have to spend a 1 hour to access Facebook. </p>
      <p>Input Lock Reset Time. The last step is that users must input the duration for the entire process to start over. Once unproductive applications have unlocked users must declare the duration until they become locked again. This can be configured manually the same as Lock Time. Users can input an hourly reset or can wait to the next calendar day. </p>
      <p>Interface. Once the locked applications are set the interface home screen will display all locked apps with a countdown timer that users must spend on productive apps. Productive apps will be listed underneath next to a settings cog. New users will be greeted with an onboarding sequence detailing the 4-step process and an overview of the interface.</p>
      
    
    <h2>Tools, Technologies & Skills Required</h2>
      <p>The techniques required to build Cram Lock are centred around iOS and Android software. Considering the business requirements are identified throughout the course of the project idea the next step would be to create a design. This can be achieved by using programs such as Sketch, Figma or InVision Studio. With the previously mentioned design tools, creating the app’s graphic design, user interface and user design would follow next. Cram Lock does not require much screen time because it is a third-party tool that locks other apps, therefore the motive would be to keep it simple and lightweight. </p>
      <p>Marketing strategy must include a landing page utilising front-end technologies; HTML, CSS and Java to demonstrate the Cram Lock’s functionality with an engaging interaction. The landing page must include a roadmap detailing important releases and milestones. Developers of Cram Lock must be proficient App Store Optimisation and Google Adwords Optimisation to increase traffic to app and landing page. </p>
      <p>The most important step is to develop the applications back-end, this can be accomplish through numerous avenues. Amazon Web Services offer a step-by-step hybrid guide to mobile application development or alternatively Cram Lock could release on iOS before Android, or vice versa. This would demand that Cram Lock be built on Swift for iOS and translated to Java or Kotlin for Android. Once completed Cram Lock can be submitted to the Application Store and or Google Play. </p>
    
    Insert Design - Sketch Front End HTML &CSS Back End Swift & Java  
      
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    
    <p>Judging that users predominately apply educational applications as productive apps and If 10,000 hours of practise can make anyone an expert (Gladwell, 2008), then Cram lock is the perfect companion tool to help users increase their written and musical literacy. The project idea of Cram Lock only suggests locking unproductive applications on a user level but now the idea exists what else can this tool be used for? Could businesses deploy auto locking of unproductive applications across their organisation. If Facebook was only available at lunch time how much more efficient could the business become without the distraction of social media during business hours? </p>
