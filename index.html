  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    
      <p>My interest in technology began when I was 7 years old when a Gameboy Colour could be found in the hand of every child. Most kids were interested in trading Pokémon, but I was more concerned with the 8-bit chiptune omitting from the speakers. I would turn on my Gameboy just to listen to the music. To time of writing I still listen to orchestral renditions of the Legend of Zelda.</p>
      <p>Since then, my love for technology evolved through the expression of music in film and art. I believe the success of most entertainment is contributed to the accomplishments of composers and sound engineers, how else can you convey the melancholy and suspense in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar without Hans Zimmer’s score? Why is opera in Italian so listenable in a language not everybody fully understands? How does the repetition of gaming continue to hold a frustrated audience? I tend to agree with Juslin & Väsfäll’s (2008) publication, that when music triggers an emotional response it can have a very strong symbiotic relationship with art.</p> 
      <p>Beckstead (2001) states that technology has revolutionised the music industry; Digital software, smartphones and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) provide anyone the potential to listen, write and record music with the push of a button. If it wasn’t for the 8-bit chiptune in my first Gameboy and the acceleration of accessible technology I doubt music would be this influential in my life today.</p>
      <p>I have chosen to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT because of the university’s reputation, course structure and networking opportunities. My plan is to advance my career in the technology space and to understand programming languages that are translatable across industries and applicable to music. As a Business Analyst I would like to further my understanding of Data Analysis, Big Data and Machine Learning, and to take advantage of the coding programs (HTML, CSS, Java, Python, C, C++, etc.) offered throughout each course.</p>
  
    <h2>IT Experience</h2>
    <p>I am Business Analyst for Tabcorp Wagering in a global leading Wagering Control Centre. During this role I have championed many projects across the technology space. In short, my experience entails the following accomplishments:</p>
 
    <p> Data Analysis 
        Improving through 6 Sigma DMAIC.
        Software Implementation 
        Applying digital transformation strategies.
        Software Design 
        Eliciting requirements via Agile.
        Release Management 
        Deploying new software.
        Machine learning 
        Feeding supervised datasets.
        Quality Assurance 
        Building test cases. 
        Application Support 
        Identifying and mitigating risk.
        Workplace (hardware) 
       Enhancing user experience.</p>
 
    <p>Each role listed above has aided my long-term goal to become Head of Technology. I would like to improve data systems and manage a team of software engineers developing innovative applications, but before I get there, I must accept the next challenge. I would like to become a Software Engineer either after graduation or before my study is complete. It is essential that I understand the computing architecture if I am ever to lead a team of software engineers, therefore I must learn programming languages and gain experience in full-stack development.</p>

  
  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    
    <h3>Position Description</h3>
      <p>I will continue to take advantage of the job opportunities and relationships I have built at Tabcorp to become a Software Engineer Lead. This position listed at Tabcorp requires the successful candidate to lead a team of developers to create and maintain gaming software in the wagering sector. Tabcorp Wagering is a gaming platform that provides gambling opportunities for racing events, sporting entertainment and lotteries. Developing gaming software suggests that these applications must be accessible via web, app (iOS and Android), and at retail venues. A key component is to redesign their digital experience and innovate wagering product through technology solutions. This would involve focusing on the UX design disciplines as explained by Green (2019); experience strategy, integration design, user research and information architecture. </p>
      <p>This position appeals to me because it is an opportunity to express my creativity through technology, much like playing piano mentioned at the beginning of my profile. Software Engineers build the architecture in the back-end and influence the design at the front-end. This type of work allows employees to work autonomously which is the biggest contributing factor to job satisfaction (Simmons, Gooty, Nelson & Little, 2009). I am an internal applicant for this role, and I have already built strong relationships across the business which can be one of the most difficult challenges when starting a new job, therefore I have a network of people to excel.</p>

    <h3>Skills & Expereince Required for Position</h3>
      <p>The necessary skills required to be a successful Software Engineer Lead include knowledge of in-demand computer programming languages (Java, Python, C#/.Net, Mean, Ruby, etc.) and business Intelligence reporting tools (Power BI, Oracle Analytics) to communicate across, down and up stream. Applicate must have experience in software development strategies involving the end-to-end process; designing, testing, implementing, and debugging. Applicant would understand how to elicit requirements from users to enhance user experience and have a grasp of Relational Database Management Systems.</p>
      <p>Applicant would need to demonstrate challenging problem-solving skills and express critical thinking in moments of crisis. Additionally, applicant must convey high-level communication and have the ability to work in a team using Agile framework. Applicant could be considered advantageous if they have gaming industry experience and are able to work on weekends or on-call. </p>
    
    <h3>Qualifications Required for Position</h3>
      <p>A successful applicant must hold a Bachelors degree in either Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Programming or Mathematics. Applicants would need 3-5 years of field experience to be considered and must possess an accomplished technology portfolio boasting achievements and design strategies. Understanding that the technology industry is continually transforming the applicant must be willing to enrol in short courses for upskilling in areas focusing on modern technology trends and delivery strategies.</p>
 
    <h3>Skills, Qualifications & Experience I currently Possess</h3>
      <p>My current role as a Business Analyst has exposed many facets of technology and the business. I am the bridge the connects technology to operations and it my duty to improve operations through technology solutions. I am agent of change and have experience in software design using agile framework and large-scale software implementation; this includes being a part of the end-to-end process by facilitating meetings with developers, showcasing requirements, building quality assurance test cases and training users on the front-line. </p>
      <p>Putting the business first before seeking improvements from technology has allowed me to understand the importance of user-experience. I hold weekly meetings presenting accurate data analysis with users so that they can suggest areas for improvement and identify risk. Applying 6 Sigma DMAIC framework has increased our operations Sigma rating from a 4 to 5.6 over the last 3 years. Minimising defects has become my operational goal and I contribute this success to constantly updating software that contains error-proofing technology. </p>
      <p>My second responsibility is to provide on-call operational support, this involves risk mitigation and damage control during unplanned system outages. My problem-solving skills are challenged weekly due to the unpredictable nature of large-scale organisations, I must minimise impact to the business while holding customer expectation. Additionally, I have 10+ years of wagering industry experience and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
    
    <h3>Plan to Obtain Missing Job Requirements</h3>
      <p>To obtain the role of Software Engineer Lead my plan is to study a Bachelor of Information Technology part-time with a slow and conservative approach to build my software portfolio and apply that to my current work. One example is that I am currently learning Python in a Programming course and I am in the process of learning data extraction from databases. I can now take these learnings and develop a program that will place all performance data into files (.xml, .xls) for performance managers to review and analyse.</p>
      <p>Along this journey I will study a minor of Software Engineering to learn a vast number of coding languages and techniques for both front-end and back-end development. I acknowledge that the Software Engineering role attached is for a lead/senior position, but over the course of my study I hope to move into Technology once I have grasped more computer science concepts. Alternatively, I can offer my services as a Junior Software Engineer when I apply for the role and review my application for the senior position once I have gained more experience. </p>
      <p>I would need further experience developing high-level innovative business strategies, business intelligence reporting tools and communicating upstream to senior management. I have no doubt that I am projected to learn these skill while studying IT, but to gain an advantage I can increase my responsibility at work. To practise communicating upstream I will ask the Head of Parimutuel Operations if I can help with budgeting and present monthly reports to her general manager. To understand the core disciplines of UX Design I will sit with the development team one day per week and ask any questions; this will help me gain the confidence to code front-end before I move into the technology space. The final requirement would be to gain experience in Software Engineering Project Management; deciding scope, cost estimation, scheduling tasks and managing resources.</p>
